## Question 1 

Given an MA(1) series as follows. (Notice this series is the same as the series in Problem 1 in the AYU)

$$y_t = 2024 + .4 \epsilon_{t-1} + \epsilon,$$

where $\epsilon \sim (0, 1)$

- Calculate $E(y_t)$, $V(y_t)$ and the autocorrelation at lag 1. 

- Simulate and plot the series.

- Calculate the sample values of the mean, the variance and the ACF at lag 1 to verify the theoretical properties of MA(1)

## Question 2 

Given an MA(2) series as follows. (Notice this series is the same as the series in Problem 2 in the AYU)

$$y_t = 2024 + .4 \epsilon_{t-1} +.1 \epsilon_{t-2} + \epsilon$$

where $\epsilon \sim (0, 1)$

- Simulate and plot the series.

- Calculate the sample values of the mean, the variance and the ACF at lag 1 to verify the theoretical properties of MA(1)

## Question 3

- Simulate an ARMA(2, 1). 

- Plot its ACF and PACF. 

## Question 4

Consider the below dataset. 

Dataset: Percentage changes in quarterly personal consumption expenditure, personal disposable income, production, savings and the unemployment rate for the US, 1970 to 2016.

[Dataset](uschange.csv)

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)
# read the data
uschange =  read.csv('uschange.csv')
# turn the data to a series
# notice frequency = 4 because this is a quarterly data
uschange = ts(uschange, start = 1970, frequency = 4)
yt = uschange[,c("Consumption")] 
```

Let $y_t$ be the series of `Consumption` in the dataset. Assume that the series is stationary. Fit an ARMA model to $y_t$. Explain your selection of the orders in ARMA. Use the fitted model to plot a forecast for the series.
