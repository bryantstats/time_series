# Components of Time Series

- We know that a series may have three components: trend, seasonality and cycle. 

- For simplicity, the trend and the cycle are usually combined into one component called trend-cycle or just trend.

Thus, a series can only be one of the three following cases

- (1) Has no trend and no seasonality

- (2) Has trend and no seasonality

- (3) Has trend and seasonality

---
# Forecasting with ES

We can use exponential smoothing to make forecast for all the three types of time series mentioned earlier. 

- Use `Simple ES` to forecast series with no trend and no seasonality

- Use `Holt’s Method` (or double ES) to forecast series with trend and no seasonality. 

- Use `Holt-Winters Method` (or triple ES): to forecast series with trend and seasonality.

# Simple Exponential Smoothing

# Simple Exponential Smoothing

- We use this method to forecast series with a constant level (no trend) and no seasonality.  The equations to calculate the forecast are as follows. 

\begin{align*}
&\text{Forecast Equation:} &\hat{y}_{t+h} &=  l_t \\
&\text{Level Equation:}    &l_t           &=  \alpha y_t + (1-\alpha)l_{t-1}
\end{align*}

- We observe that  $w = 1- \alpha$ in exponential smoothing that we defined last week. 

- The forecast calculation needs two parameters  $l_0$ (initial level) and $\alpha$ (smoothing parameter)

---
# Parameters Estimation

- We notice that different parameters ( $l_0$ and $\alpha$) will yield different forecasting

- What would be the parameters yield the best forecasting?

- The bets parameters are the parameters that produces $\hat{y}_t$ that minimizes the sum squares errors (SSE)

$$
SSE = \sum_{t=1}^T(y_t - \hat{y}_t)
$$

---
# SES in R

- We will use SES to make forecast for the time series of annual rainfall in London since 1813. 

[Dataset](data/rainfall_london.csv)

---
# SES in R

- We first plot the series to see if we could use SES to make forecasts. 

```{r}
library(forecast)
rain <- read.csv('data/rainfall_london.csv')
y <- ts(rain,start=c(1813))
plot(y)
```

- The plot indicates that the series has no trend and no seasonality.  So we can use SES on this series. 


---
# SES in R

- We can use function `ses` to implement SES

```{r}
y_h = ses(y, h = 5)
y_h$model
```

- What are the best parameters for this SES?  We notice that $\alpha = 1e-04$ and $l_0 = 24.8243$

---
# SES in R

- Plot the smoothed series

```{r}
plot(y)
lines(y_h$fitted, col = 'red')
```

- We notice that the smoothed series since $\alpha \approx 0$, the smoothing is at its maximum where the smoothed series is just the average of the original series (and vice versa, $\alpha = 1$ would make the smoothed series the same as the original series, or no smoothing at all).   

---
# SES in R

- Make the forecast

```{r}
y_h
```

- The forecast is a constant going to the future

---
# SES in R

- Plot the forecast

```{r}
plot(y_h)
```

# Problem 1

Given the following time series $y_t$.     

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
y = ts(c(2.5, 3, 1.7, 2, 2.8))
kable(tibble(t = c(1:length(y)), y = y))
```

- Assume that the series does not have the trend and seasonality component. What is the parameters of simple exponential smoothing that best forecast the series? 

- Make a forecast using the SES with these parameters to forecast the three next values of the series.

---
# Solution

- We will use R to solve this problem.  We first create the series then use the `ses` function to find the best parameters. 

```{r}
# Create the series using the ts function
y = ts(c(2.5, 3, 1.7, 2, 1.8))

# implement SES 
y_h = ses(y, h = 3)
y_h$model
```

- We observe that the best parameters are $l_0 = 2.5$ and $\alpha = 0.3869$

---
# Solution

The forecast of the three next values are

```{r}
y_h
```

---
# Solution

The forecast of the three next values are

```{r}
plot(y)
lines(y_h$fitted, col = 'red')

# Holt's Method



---
# Holt's Method

- We use this method to forecast series with a constant trend and no seasonality.  The equations to calculate the forecast are as follows. 

\begin{align*}
&\text{Forecast Equation:} &\hat{y}_{t+h} &=  l_t + hb_t \\
&\text{Level Equation:}    &l_t           &=  \alpha y_t + (1-\alpha)(l_{t-1}+b_{t-1}) \\
&\text{Trend Equation:}    &b_t           &=  \beta^{*}(l_t - l_{t-1}) + (1-\beta^{*})b_{t-1}
\end{align*}

- The forecast calculation needs the following parameters

    - $l_0$ (initial level value), 
    - $b_0$ (initial trend value)
    - $\alpha$ (level smoothing parameter) and 
    - $\beta^{*}$ (trend smoothing parameter)
    
- Similar to the SES model, these parameters are estimated by minimizing the $SSE = \sum_{t=1}^T(y_t - \hat{y}_t)$

# Example

- Let consider the series of total annual air passengers including domestic and international aircraft passengers of air carriers registered in Australia. 1970-2009.

[Dataset](data/ausair.csv)

---
# Example

- Plot the series

```{r}
df <- read.csv('data/ausair.csv')
y = ts(df, start = c(1970), frequency = 1)
plot(y)
```

- We observe that the series has a trend (upward) so we can use Holt's method to make forecast for this series


---
# Example

- We use the `holt` function to implement the Holt's method as follows

```{r}
y_h <- holt(y, h=5)
y_h$model
```

- We can read the estimated parameters from the results.

---
# Example

- Plot the smoothed series

```{r}
plot(y)
lines(y_h$fitted, col = 'red')
```

---
# Example

- Plot the smoothed series

```{r}
plot(y)
lines(y_h$fitted, col = 'red')
```

- Since $\alpha = 0.848$ are quite large (closer to 1), the smoothing is very light making the smoothed series is very close to the original series. 

---
# Example

- Make the forecast

```{r}
y_h
```


---
# Example

- Plot the forecast

```{r}
plot(y_h)

# Damped trend methods


---
# Damped trend methods

- Holt’s method produce a linear forecasting into the future. The slope of this linear trend is a constant

- Empirical evidence indicates that these methods tend to over-forecast, especially for longer forecast horizons.

- The Damped trend methods introduced a parameter that “dampens” the trend to a flat line some time in the future. 

- Damped trend methods have proven to be very successful, and are among the most popular individual methods. 


---
# Damped trend methods

- We use this method to forecast series with a constant trend and no seasonality.  The equations to calculate the forecast are as follows. 

\begin{align*}
&\text{Forecast Equation:} &\hat{y}_{t+h} &=  l_t + (\phi + \phi^2 + ... + \phi^h)b_t \\
&\text{Level Equation:}    &l_t           &=  \alpha y_t + (1-\alpha)(l_{t-1}+\phi b_{t-1}) \\
&\text{Trend Equation:}    &b_t           &=  \beta^{*}(l_t - l_{t-1}) + (1-\beta^{*})\phi b_{t-1}
\end{align*}

- The forecast calculation needs the following parameters

    - $l_0$ (initial level value), 
    - $b_0$ (initial trend value)
    - $\alpha$ (level smoothing parameter) and 
    - $\beta^{*}$ (trend smoothing parameter)
    - $\phi$, damping parameter, $0 < \phi <1$
    
- Notice that when $\phi = 1$, the Damped trend methods become the Holt's method

- In practice, $\phi$ is usually chosen from .8 to .98


---
# Example

- We use the same `holt` function to implement the method. 

```{r}
y_h <- holt(y, damped = TRUE, h=5)
y_h$model
```

- We can read the estimated parameters from the results.

---
# Example

- Plot the smoothed series

```{r}
plot(y)
lines(y_h$fitted, col = 'red')
```
---
# Example

- Plot the forecast

```{r}
plot(y_h)
```

# Problem 2

Given the following time series $y_t$.     

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
y = ts(c(2.5, 3, 4.7, 5, 7.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12.5))
kable(tibble(t = c(1:length(y)), y = y))
```

- Assume that the series have the trend and no seasonality component. What is the parameters of Holt's method that best forecast the series? 

- Make a forecast for the next value of the series

---
# Solution

- We will use R to solve this problem. 

```{r}
# Create the series using the ts function
y = ts(c(2.5, 3, 4.7, 5, 7.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12.5))

# implement Holt 
y_h = holt(y, h = 1)
y_h$model
```
- The best parameters are found above

---
# Solution

The forecast of the three next values are

```{r}
y_h
```

---
# Solution

The forecast of the three next values are

```{r}
plot(y)
lines(y_h$fitted, col = 'red')
```

---
# Problem 3

Given the following time series $y_t$.     

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
y = ts(c(2.5, 3, 4.7, 5, 7.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12.5))
kable(tibble(t = c(1:length(y)), y = y))
```

- Assume that the series have the trend and seasonality component. What is the parameters of Damped Holt's method that best forecast the series? 

- Make a forecast for the next value of the series


---
# Solution

- We will use R to solve this problem. The parameters are as follows.

```{r}
# Create the series using the ts function
y = ts(c(2.5, 3, 4.7, 5, 7.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12.5))

# implement Holt 
y_h = holt(y, damped =  TRUE, h = 1)
y_h$model
```
- The forecast of the next value is

```{r}
y_h
```

# Holt-Winters’ seasonal method

# Holt-Winters’ seasonal method

- We use this method to forecast series with a trend and seasonality.  

- There are two variations to this method that differ in the nature of the seasonal component 

    - Holt-Winters’ additive method
    
    - Holt-Winters’ multiplicative method


---
# Holt-Winters’ additive method

Holt-Winters’ additive method's Equations are as follows. 

\begin{align*}
&\text{Forecast Equation:} &\hat{y}_{t+h} &=  l_t + hb_t + s_{t+h-mk-m} \\
&\text{Level Equation:}    &l_t           &=  \alpha (y_t - s_{t-m} + (1-\alpha)(l_{t-1}+ b_{t-1}) \\
&\text{Trend Equation:}    &b_t           &=  \beta^{*}(l_t - l_{t-1}) + (1-\beta^{*}) b_{t-1} \\
&\text{Seasonal Equation:}    &s_t           &=  \gamma (y_t - l_{t-1} - b_{t-1}) + (1-\gamma) s_{t-m}
\end{align*}

- The forecast calculation needs six parameters

    - $l_0$ (initial level value), 
    - $b_0$ (initial trend value)
    - $s_0$ (initial trend value)
    - $\alpha$ (level smoothing parameter) and 
    - $\beta^{*}$ (trend smoothing parameter)
    - $\gamma$ (seasonal smoothing parameter)

# Holt-Winters’ multiplicative method    
    
Holt-Winters’ additive method's Equations are as follows. 

\begin{align*}
&\text{Forecast Equation:} &\hat{y}_{t+h} &=  (l_t + hb_t)s_{t+h-mk-m} \\
&\text{Level Equation:}    &l_t           &=  \alpha (y_t/s_{t-m} + (1-\alpha)(l_{t-1}+ b_{t-1}) \\
&\text{Trend Equation:}    &b_t           &=  \beta^{*}(l_t - l_{t-1}) + (1-\beta^{*}) b_{t-1} \\
&\text{Seasonal Equation:}    &s_t           &=  \gamma y_t/(l_{t-1} - b_{t-1}) + (1-\gamma) s_{t-m}
\end{align*}

- The forecast calculation needs six parameters

    - $l_0$ (initial level value), 
    - $b_0$ (initial trend value)
    - $s_0$ (initial trend value)
    - $\alpha$ (level smoothing parameter) and 
    - $\beta^{*}$ (trend smoothing parameter)
    - $\gamma$ (seasonal smoothing parameter)

# Example

- We study the Quarterly visitor nights (in millions) spent by international tourists to Australia. 1999-2015.

[Dataset](data/austourists.csv)

```{r}
df <- read.csv('data/austourists.csv')
y = ts(df, start = c(1999), frequency = 4)

plot(y)
```    

- The plot shows the trend and the seasonal component of the series.  Thus, we can use the HW method on this series

---
# Example

- Holt-Winters' additive method 

```{r}
y_h <- hw(y,seasonal="additive")
y_h$model
```

---
# Example

- Plot the smoothed series

```{r}
plot(y)
lines(y_h$fitted, col = 'red')
```

---
# Example

- Plot the forecast

```{r}
plot(y_h)
```


---
# Example

- We can easily switch to the multiplicative model

```{r}
y_h <- hw(y,seasonal="multiplicative")
y_h$model
```

---
# Example

- Plot the smoothed series

```{r}
plot(y)
lines(y_h$fitted, col = 'red')
```


---
# Example

- Plot the forecast

```{r}
plot(y_h)
```
    
    
---
# Additive vs. Multiplicative Model


- The forecasts generated by the method with the multiplicative seasonality display larger and increasing seasonal variation. 

- Thus for series that has increasing size of the seasonal component we would prefer the multiplicative model


---
# Additive vs. Multiplicative Model

- Let's take a closer look at the series in the previous example

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(y)
```

- We observe that the seasonal variation of the series seems to increase overtime.  Thus, the multiplicative model may fit the series better

- However, we can always use both models and evaluate the forecast performance on a separate dataset to decide which model make a better forecast

---
# Holt-Winters’ damped method

- Damping is possible with both additive and multiplicative Holt-Winters’ methods

```{r}
y_h <- hw(y,seasonal="additive", damped = TRUE)
plot(y_h)
```
