## Problem 1

Which one/ones are TRUE in the following statements?

1. ARMA model cannot be used to fit time series with trend.

2. ARIMA model cannot be used to fit time series with trend.

3. One can use differencing technique to transform a trend series to statonary then use ARMA model to fit the transformed series. 


## Problem 2

Rewrite the following model using the backshift notation

1. 

$$y_t = 1 + y_{t-1}+.3y_{t-2} - y_{t-7} + \epsilon_t$$

2. 

$$y_t = 1 + y_{t-1}+.3y_{t-2} - y_{t-7} + \epsilon_t + \epsilon_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t-5}$$

## Problem 3

Write the equation of the ARIMA(1,2,1)

## Problem 4

Which one/ones are TRUE in the following statements?

1. If the Mean absolute percentage error
 (MAPE) of model 1 is lower than the MAPE of model 2 then the AIC of model 1 is also lower than the AIC of model 2.
 
2. If the log-likelihood of model 1 is greater than the log-likelihood of model 2 then the AIC of model 1 is also lower than the AIC of model 2.
