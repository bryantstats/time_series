## Question 1: Random Walk Simulation

- Simulate a random walk where the white-noise is a  student-t distribution with degree freedom of 2024. (Use the function `rt` to generate the t random variables, i.e. `rt(n, df = 2024)`)

- Plot the random walk

- Plot the acf of a random walk.  Does the autocorrelation stays in the blue strip?

- Plot the differenced series of the random walk.

- Plot the acf of the differenced series. 

- Does the differenced series have signs of a white-noise?


## Question 2: Modeling with Random Walk

- Use the `quantmod` package to plot the stock of Apple in 2024. 

- Plot differenced series of the stock

- Plot the ACF of the stock

- Does the differenced series have signs of a white-noise?

- Use the random walk model to make and plot a forecast for the stock. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(quantmod)
getSymbols('AAPL', src='yahoo')
y = Ad(AAPL[index(AAPL)>"2023-01-01",])
d = diff(y)
plot(d)
acf(d, na.action = na.pass)
```
