## Question 1 

1. Simulate an AR(1) series with positive slope  using the `arima.sim` function. Plot the ACF of the series.  Comment on the ACF. 

2. Simulate an AR(1) series with negative slope  using the `arima.sim` function. Plot the ACF of the series.  Comment on the ACF. 

3. Simulate an AR(1) series.  Use the `arima` function to estimate the coefficients of the series.  Increase the length of the series to see if that improves the accuracy of the estimation.  

## Question 2

Consider the dataset of Percentage changes in quarterly personal consumption expenditure, personal disposable income, production, savings and the unemployment rate for the US, 1970 to 2016. 

[Dataset](uschange.csv)

1. Create the time series `Income` from the dataset. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df = read_csv('uschange.csv')
y = ts(df$Income, frequency = 4, start = c(1970, 1))
```

2. Investigate the stationarity of the series by plotting the series and its ACF.

3. If the series is stationary, fit an AR(1) model to the series and make a forecast for the next value. 

## Question 3

Using the `quantmod` package to do the follows. 

1. Import the series Microsoft stock (`MSFT`) in 2024

2. Plot the stock and its ACF. Is the stock stationary?

3. If the stock is not stationary, apply the differencing technique to transform.

4. Is the differenced series of the stock stationary? Inspect the ACF of the stock to answer the question. 

5. If the differenced series is stationary, fit an AR(1) model to the series 

6. Make a forecast for the next value of the MSFT stock.
