Use the sample codes from the class slides to complete this Assignment

## Question 1.

We will work on the below dataset.

Dataset: Percentage changes in quarterly personal consumption expenditure, personal disposable income, production, savings and the unemployment rate for the US, 1970 to 2016.

[Download](uschange.csv)

Do the follows.

1. Run a linear regression with the response variable `Consumption` and predictor `Production `. 

2. Write the equation with the estimated parameters. 

3. Report the $R^2$. 

4. Plot the scatter plot between the fitted values and the response values. How well the model fit the data?

5. Forecast the next value of the `consumption` by setting the value of the predictor to be the average of the `Production`. (You can see [this slide](https://bryantstats.github.io/time_series/note4#53) for a sample code)

6. Redo 1-5 with the the response variable `Consumption` and predictors are the remaining variables (i.e., `Income`, `Production`, `Savings` and `Unemployment`). 

7. Suppose we can only choose two predictors for the response `Consumption`.  What are the two predictors that give the highest $R^2$? (For this question you will need to run all the possible regression with two predictors to choose the pair that produces the greatest $R^2$) 


## Question 2. 

Given the following time series.  

Dataset: Monthly Airline Passenger Numbers 1949-1960

[Download](AirPassengers.csv)

1. Import the data and apply an appropriate linear regression on the series.  

2. Report the $R^2$ of the model.  

3. Plot the scatter plot between the fitted values and the response values. 

4. How well the model fit the data?

5. Plot a forecast on the next values of the series.
