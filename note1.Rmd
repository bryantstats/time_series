# Time Series Models

We can generate time series from a time series models.  Here are some examples of time series models. 

- $y_t =  1+2t + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$

- $y_t =  1 + y_{t-1} + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$ and $y_1 = 1$

# Three Components of Time Series

---
# Time Series Patterns

A time series may consist of 

- trend, 

- seasonality and 

- cycles

---
# Trend

- A trend is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. 

- Trend does not have to be linear. 

- Sometimes we will refer to a trend as changing direction, when it might go from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend. 

---
# Examples

![](images/ts6.png)

- There is a downward trend. The US treasury bill contracts show results from the Chicago market for 100 consecutive trading days in 1981. 

---
# Examples

![](images/ts7.png)

- There is no apparent trend in the data over this period

---
# Cycle and Seasonal

- cycle: repeated events over time that are not equally spaced

- seasonal: repeated events over time that are equally spaced

---
# Examples

![](images/ts7.png)

- The monthly housing sales show strong seasonality within each year, as well as some strong cyclic behavior with a period of about 6-10 years

---
# Examples

![](images/ts8.png)

The Australian quarterly electricity production shows a strong increasing trend, with strong seasonality. There is no evidence of any cyclic behavior here

---
# Examples

![](images/ts9.png)

- No trend, seasonality or cyclic behaviour. There are random fluctuations which do not appear to be very predictable, and no strong patterns that would help with developing a forecasting model.

# Correlogram and ACF

---
# Correlation and Auto-correlation

- The correlation between two variables measure how strong the linear relation between them. 

- The correlation between a time series $y_t$ and the yesterday's version of itself $y_{t-1}$ is call Auto-correlation at lag 1. 

- Auto-correlation lag with lag $k$ is the the correlation between the time series $y_t$ and $y_{t-k}$

- Auto-correlation at lag $k$ is

![](images/acf2.png)

---
# Correlation and Auto-correlation

- Auto-correlation lag with lag k is the the correlation between the time series $y_t$ and $y_{t-k}$

- Auto-correlation lag with lag 0 is always 1

- The Correlogram is the plot of the Auto-correlations for values of lag k = 0, 1, 2,...

- The Auto-correlation function (ACF) is the function where the input is a lag and the output is the Auto-correlation of the lag.

# Problem 1

| t   | $y_t$ |
|:----|:------|
| 1   | 1     |
| 2   | 3     |

| 4   | 8     |
| 5   | 12    |
| 6   | 13    |
| 7   | 16    |

Calculate the auto-correlation at lag 1 ( $r_1$ ) and at lag 2 ( $r_2$ )

---
# Solution

- $\bar{y} = \frac{1+3+5+8+12}{5}=5.8$

- Form the table

| t   | $y_t$ | $y_t -  \bar{y}$ | $y_t -  \bar{y}$ |
|:----|:------|:------|:------|
| 1   | 1     | -4.8      |  -4.8       |
| 2   | 3     | -2.8     | -2.8       |
| 3   | 5     | -0.8     |-0.8        |

| 5   | 12    | 6.2     |  6.2      |

- Calculate the denominator of $r_1$: $$\sum(y_t-\bar{y})^2 = (-4.8)^2+(-2.8)^2+(-.8)^2+2.2^2+6.2^2 = 74.8$$

- Calculate the numerator of $r_1$: $$(-4.8)*(-2.8) + (-2.8)*(-0.8) + (-0.8)*(2.2)+(2.2)*(6.2) = 27.56$$

- $r_1 = 27.56/74.8 = 0.368$

# Solution

- $\bar{y} = \frac{1+3+5+8+12}{5}=5.8$

- Form the table

| t   | $y_t$ | $y_t -  \bar{y}$ | $y_t -  \bar{y}$ |

| 5   | 12    | 6.2     |  6.2      |

- Calculate the denominator of $r_2$ (the same as $r_1$ or any $r_k$) : $$\sum(y_t-\bar{y})^2 = (-4.8)^2+(-2.8)^2+(-.8)^2+2.2^2+6.2^2 = 74.8$$

- Calculate the numerator of $r_2$: $$(-4.8)*(-0.8) + (-2.8)*(2.2) + (-0.8)*(6.2) = -7.28$$

- $r_2 = -7.28/74.8 = -0.0973$

# Correlogram a time series with trend

- Usually a trend in the data will show in the correlogram as a slow decay in the Auto-correlation

```{r}
y = ts(c(1:100))
acf(y)
```

---
# The Correlogram - Example

```{r}
y = ts(cos(c(1:100))+rnorm(100))
acf(y)
```

---
# ACF of a time series with seasonality

```{r}
set.seed(30)
y = cos(1:100)
y <- ts(y)
acf(y)

# Stationary

---
# Stationary

- A common assumption in many time series techniques is that the series are stationary.

- What is stationary?

- Intuitively, stationarity means that the statistical properties of a series do not change over time.

---
# Definition

-   A time series $y_t$ is stationary if

    -   $E(y_t) = constant$

    -   $Cov(y_t, y_s)$ only depends on the time lag $|t-s|$

-   If $y_t$ is stationary then $Var(y_t) = Constant$



---
# Series with Trend/Seasonality

- Series with trend or seasonality are not stationary


---
# Example

```{r}
set.seed(30)
n = 100
e <- ts(rnorm(n, sd = 10))
t = c(1:n)
y = 2*t+3+e
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(y) + ggtitle("")
```

---
# Example

```{r}
set.seed(30)
n = 100
e <- ts(rnorm(n, sd = 10))
t = c(1:n)
y = 2*t+3+e
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(y) + ggtitle("Non-stationary due to non-constant expected value")
```

- Time series with trend (hence the mean is not a constant) is not stationary. 


---
# Example


```{r}
set.seed(10)
y <- arima.sim(list(order=c(0,1,0)), n=1000)
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(y) + ggtitle("A Non-Stationary Time Series")
```

- This is a plot of a Random Walk series. The series is not stationary because the expected value (the mean) is changing over time, i.e. the series has trend. 

---
# Example

```{r}
set.seed(30)
n = 200
e <- ts(rnorm(n, sd = .1))
t = cos(.2*c(1:n))
y = t+e
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(y) + ggtitle("Non-stationary due to seasonality")
```

- Time series with seasonality is not stationary. 


---
# Example

```{r}
set.seed(30)
n = 100
e1 <- rnorm(n, sd = 1)
e2 <- rnorm(n, sd = 10)
e3 <- rnorm(n, sd = 50)
y = c(e1,e2,e3)
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(ts(y)) + ggtitle("")
```

---
# Example

```{r}
set.seed(30)
n = 100
e1 <- rnorm(n, sd = 1)
e2 <- rnorm(n, sd = 10)
e3 <- rnorm(n, sd = 50)
y = ts(c(e1,e2,e3))
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(y) + ggtitle("Non-stationary due to non-constant variance")
```


---
# Example

```{r}
set.seed(10)
y <- ts(rnorm(200))
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(y) + ggtitle("A Stationary Time Series")
```

- This is a stationary series where both the mean and variance stay constant. 


---
# Stationarity Analysis

We can inverstigate the stationarity of a time series using the following tools. 

- Its ACF

- The Ljung-Box test for independence

- The Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) t-statistic test for unit root

- The Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) for level or trend stationarity

---
# ACF of stationary series

- ACF of stationary usually quickly goes to zeros.

- For example: below is the ACF of a stationary series

```{r}
set.seed(2024)
y = ts(rnorm(100))
acf(y)
```
---
# ACF of stationary series

- ACF of stationary usually quickly goes to zeros. Going zeroes here means the values is within the blue strip.  

- For example: below is the ACF of a stationary series

```{r}
set.seed(2024)
y = arima.sim(list(order=c(1,0,0), ar=c(.4)), n=100)
acf(y)
```

---
# ACF of trend series

- ACF of time series with trend (hence, not stationary) usually decreases slowly. 

- For example: below is the ACF of a linear trend (hence, not stationary) series. We observe that the ACF does not die out to zero (does not converge into the blue strip).

```{r}
set.seed(2024)
y = ts(c(100:1)+ rnorm(100))
acf(y)
```
---
# ACF of seasonal series

- Below is the ACF of a time series with seasonality (hence, not stationary). We observe that the ACF does not die out to zero (does not converge into the blue strip).

```{r}
set.seed(2024)
y = ts(5*cos(c(1:100))+ rnorm(100))
acf(y)
```

---
# Time Series Transformation

- A non-stationary time series $y_t$ can be transformed to stationary series $z_t$ for modeling.  There are two basic transformations.  

- Differencing: $z_t = y_{t}-y_{t-1}$. 

- Log transformation: $z_t = \log(y_t)$.  This transformation can stabilize variance by reducing the impact of extreme values.

# White Noise

---
# Basic Time Series

- There are some basic time series or models such as

- White Noise Series/Models

- Random Walk Series/Models

- Simple Autoregressive Models

---
# White-Noise

-   $y_t$ is a white-noise process (series) if $y_1$, $y_2$,..., $y_t$ are independent identical distributed (iid) zero mean random variables from a certain distribution (usually normal)

---
# Example

```{r}
set.seed(30)
y <- ts(rnorm(100))
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(y) + ggtitle("White noise of Standard Normal Distribution")
```
---
# Example

```{r}
set.seed(30)

y = sample(c(-1, 1), 100, replace = TRUE)

y <- ts(y)
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(y) + ggtitle("White noise of Tossing a Coin")
```

---
# Stationary of a white noise

- White-Noise is stationary

```{r}
set.seed(10)
y <- ts(rnorm(200))
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(y) + ggtitle("A Stationary Time Series")
```

---
# Correlogram a white noise

- Correlogram of a white noise

```{r}
# create a white-noise time series
y = ts(rnorm(100))

# plot its ACF or correlogram 
acf(y)
```

---
# Correlogram a white noise

```{r}
set.seed(30)
y = sample(c(-1, 1), 100, replace = TRUE)
y <- ts(y)
acf(y)
```
